# Agentic Stock Analysis System with AutoGen  

üöÄ **Exploring the Future of Autonomous AI with AutoGen!**  

This project showcases an **Agentic Stock Analysis System**, built using Microsoft's **AutoGen** framework. The system leverages a team of autonomous AI agents to collaboratively analyze stock performance, generate financial reports, and visualize data‚Äîall with minimal human intervention.  

The project demonstrates the **transformative potential of autonomous AI** in revolutionizing workflows in industries like finance, research, and beyond.

## üß† Highlights of AutoGen's Agent Collaboration  

What makes this project truly unique is the seamless collaboration between multiple autonomous agents, each with a specialized role:  

- **Financial Assistant**: Analyzes stock performance, crunches numbers, and prepares visualizations.  
- **Research Assistant**: Gathers market news and identifies relevant context for stock movements.  
- **Writer Agent**: Synthesizes insights into a professional financial report, complete with markdown formatting.  
- **Critic Agent**: Reviews the writer‚Äôs work and provides constructive feedback to improve quality.  
- **Reviewers (Legal, Consistency, Completion)**:  
  - **Legal Reviewer**: Ensures compliance with legal standards.  
  - **Consistency Reviewer**: Validates data consistency across the report.  
  - **Completion Reviewer**: Verifies that all required elements (e.g., news, metrics, and visualizations) are included.  
- **Meta Reviewer**: Aggregates feedback from all reviewers and provides actionable suggestions for improvement.

## üéØ Key Features  

1. **Autonomous Workflow**: Agents communicate, review, and improve outputs collaboratively, mimicking a real-world team dynamic.  
2. **Stock Analysis**:  
   - Analyzes stock prices over the last six months.  
   - Visualizes normalized stock prices.  
   - Extracts and compares key metrics (e.g., P/E ratio, ROE).  
3. **Market News Insights**: Summarizes and contextualizes relevant headlines for each stock, without sentiment analysis.  
4. **Professional Financial Reports**:  
   - Includes detailed analysis of metrics and correlations.  
   - Provides future scenario predictions.  
   - Integrates visualizations and tables for clarity.  
5. **Code Execution Autonomy**: Agents independently generate and execute code without relying on external libraries, a unique strength of AutoGen.

## üí° Why AutoGen?  

While frameworks like LangChain excel in task execution, **AutoGen** truly stands out for its ability to foster **agent collaboration and autonomy**. This project highlights:  

- **Teamwork Among Agents**: Agents don‚Äôt just execute tasks; they communicate, review, and refine each other‚Äôs work.  
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Agents autonomously generate, execute, and validate code, minimizing external dependencies.  
- **Scalability**: The system can be easily extended with additional agents or workflows.
